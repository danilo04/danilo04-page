In this article, we will explore the implement of effects of pinch zoom in Compose and try to understand the different APIs that we can use to achieve this. Some of the effects that we will explore are:
- Pinch zoom: is a common gesture in mobile applications. It is used to zoom in and out of a view. 
- Panning: is a common gesture in mobile applications. It is used to move a view around.

## The GraphicsLayer API

Le us introduce one component that we will use to apply the effects: the **GraphicsLayer**. GraphicsLayer is a drawing layer that records drawing commands into a display list and stores rendering properties. It isolates parts of a scene so they can be updated independently without rebuilding the whole scene. Transformations can be applied without re-recording the display list.


When drawing the display list into a destination Canvas, you can apply transformations by setting `scaleX`, `scaleY`, `translationX`, `translationY`, `rotationX`, `rotationY`, or `rotationZ`.

Imagine we have an Imagen that we want to apply a zoom effect to. We can control the zoom effect by setting the `scaleX` and `scaleY` properties.
```kotlin
Image(
    ... // other properties
    modifier = Modifier.graphicsLayer {
        scaleX = 2f
        scaleY = 2f
    }
)
```

In this example, we are setting the `scaleX` and `scaleY` properties to `2f`, which means that the image will be zoomed in by 2 times.

To evaluate how the GraphicsLayer API works, I built a simple example to show how scale and translation works. 

<Video src="/sample-app-graphics-layer.mp4" />


First, we use the `Modifier.graphicsLayer` modifier to set the `scaleX` and `scaleY` properties using values from a `Slider`. Similarly, we use a `Slider` to set the `translationX` and `translationY` properties.

```kotlin
class ZoomableState(
    initialScale: Float = 1f,
    val minScale: Float = 1f,
    val maxScale: Float = 5f
) {
     var offset by mutableStateOf(Offset.Zero)
        internal set
    ... // rest of the implementation.
}

@Composable
private fun GalleryImage(zoomableState: ZoomableState, modifier: Modifier = Modifier) {
    val id = R.drawable.happy_dog
    Surface(modifier = modifier.fillMaxSize()) {
        val context = LocalContext.current
        val model = remember(id) {
            ImageRequest.Builder(context).data(id).build()
        }

        AsyncImage(
            model = model,
            contentDescription = null,
            modifier = Modifier.graphicsLayer {
                scaleX = zoomableState.scale
                scaleY = zoomableState.scale
                translationX = zoomableState.offset.x
                translationY = zoomableState.offset.y
            },
            contentScale = ContentScale.Fit,
        )
    }
}
```

Now that we have the tools to apply the effects to the images, we now focus on detecting the user gestures.
